* A reason for the significant drop in avg. temperature in 2020 is likely due to the reduced travel caused by COVID-19 restrictions resulting in less heat on trains.
* It is likely that changes to climate are impacting the temperatures experienced on trains.
* The Subsurface lines (Circle, District, Metropolitan, Hammersmith & City lines) are stocked by the 'S Stock' S7 & S8 trains which are air-conditioned throughout. The subsurface tunnels also allow the exhausted hot air to disperse.
* It seems that the avg. temperature of the Victoria line is going up by __0.72 degrees__ yearly! This is significantly higher than other deep-level tube lines. There seems to be no sufficient explanation for this. The Victoria line is also one of two lines [to be wholly-underground](https://www.mylondon.news/news/zone-1-news/london-underground-employee-explains-victoria-24708836) (the other being the Waterloo & City line) so one might postulate that trapped heat would have a hard time escaping and sink into the tunnel walls.

As we can see from the plots, the ambient temperature in London is generally predictive of the temperature on different TfL Underground lines. However, how predictive it is varies for each line.
* The Subsurface Lines have an R-squared number of 0.976. These lines are fully air-conditioned with [very specific thermostat settings](https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/transparency/freedom-of-information/foi-request-detail?referenceId=FOI-0659-1920) which would explain the strong correlation.
* Most lines are generally within **0.75** to **0.95** with variation from the ambient (how much hotter the tube is than ambient) between 2 and 14ÀöC.
* The most erratic line is the Victoria line only registering an R-squared number of **0.6**. It has been very challenging to find any data or reasonable explanations for the trends exhibited by the Victoria line data. It has the newest stock of any line besides the Subsurface lines and is equipped with regenerative braking. As of 2019, the line also became the 2nd average hottest line on the Underground network.
* As mentioned earlier, the fact the Victoria line is the only wholly-undergound line could be a factor but without further data or context, it is hard to ascertain what causes this.
